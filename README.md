#Overview: This project aims to predict cognitive score based on specific variables. The goal is to be able to provide knowledge into someones cognitive health, so they are able to make further decision in order to improve.

#Reflection: I thoroughly enjoyed this project. Being able to put my supervised learning skills to the test was a great learning experience. As well as seeing the possibility of how effective machine learning can help solve real world problems.
